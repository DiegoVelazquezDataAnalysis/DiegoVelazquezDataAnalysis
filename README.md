# About me
After using Python at SFU to help me write reports on experiments, fit theoretical models for data collected, and plot my findings, I found a branch of IT, namely data analysis, whose main focus is that. I find passion in trying to find patterns from data and translate it into useful information.
I am currently taking an intensive data analysis bootcamp, where I have strengthened my Python abilities with data wrangling and visualizations; moreover, I am acquiring a new set of skills to mine data, such as SQL or through APIs.
