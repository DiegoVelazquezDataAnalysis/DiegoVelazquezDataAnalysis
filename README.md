# About me
It all started during my years at SFU, when I discovered Python's power for something more than just programming: it could analyze real data, fit theoretical models, and visualize experiment results. 

Today, I'm dedicated to strengthening that path through an intensive learning process that has allowed me to perfect my skills in data analysis, cleaning, and visualization with Python, in addition to incorporating new tools like SQL and the use of APIs to obtain information from different sources.

My next step is to put all this knowledge to work on projects that transform data into strategic decisions. I firmly believe that the combination of curiosity, method, and communication can turn data into a powerful language to improve how we understand the world.
